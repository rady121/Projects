This game was created as a part of the Lab1 project with my colleague fadi, a fully functioning "brick breaker" game written in system verilog and burned onto an FPGA based board.
A lot of work has been put into this project, the game was polished and overdid its purpose.
the game includes 3 levels (1 was requested), powerups which were especially challenging to code but we managed to, interactive sound effects and scoring algorithm.
